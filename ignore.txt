I followed the procedure A-Z to complete and setup this project:

I will follow the modular file structure in this project.

1. To initiate a NodeJs project:
npm init -y

2. setup the typescript & update the tsconfig file
tsc --init

3. Initiate the src folder and create server.ts

4. Installing further packages:
npm i express cors mongoose

5. install ts node dev and dotenv

6. setup the mongodb server:

- setup env file system
- create a .env file and setup the keys, links there
- create a folder named 'config'
- create a file named index.ts under config folder
- setup the index file under config to use dotenv

7. Install and USE ZOD for request validation and API safety
